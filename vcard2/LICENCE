This package is hereby dedicated to the public domain by the author.

(It is derived from a package by Andreas Haberstroh, who claimed that the licence
was the "PHP" licence. Each file in the package claimed to be part of PHP4.
In any case, the wording of the licence itself was clearly inapplicable to the
package as compiled by Haberstroh, since the source files did not comply with
the terms of the licence.)
