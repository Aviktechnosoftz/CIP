<h2 id="L485">2. Introduction</h2>

<p>This package is intended to help working with IMC files, of which the two
most noted instances are vCard files (.vcf) and iCalendar files (.icf).</p>

<p>The purpose of this manual is not to reiterate the inline documentation -
which is extensive - but to explain some of the conceptual background behind
the class design and, in general terms, its current functionality. It also aims
to point the reader at strategies for using the classes in the package to get
to the desired results.</p>

<p>It is well to note that much work is done by iterators. It will be helpful
to understand the basic mechanism by which iterators are combined to traverse
complex data structures and simplify datasets.</p>

<p>It is intended that this documentation should support the <a
href="index.html">inline documentation</a>. This has been designed to work with
the <a href="http://docblox-project.org/">docblox system</a>, which is freely
available via PEAR. Please do install docblox and study the class hierarchy
diagram that it generates.</p>

<h2 id="L491">3. Namespace</h2>

<p>Class names in this document are often not qualified, for readability.
However, all classes defined in this package should be understood as referring
to the "imc" namespace. So, for example, ComponentSet, Component, Property,
vCard and iCalendar should (when used in an appropriate context) be understood
to be qualified as <code>imc\ComponentSet</code>, <code>imc\Component</code>,
<code>imc\Property</code>, etc. This package does not expose anything to the
global namespace.</p>

<h2 id="L495">4. What are IMC Components? Some terminology</h2>

<p>Both vCard and iCalendar files contain one or more vCard or iCalendar
components. In the case of iCalendar components, they in turn contain other
components, so as to produce a component tree. We may refer to these (for the
purposes of this document) as "IMC Components". Clearly we cannot represent an
iCalendar or vCard <em>file</em> as an iCalendar or vCard component: rather,
they are simple collections of one or more such components. We refer to these
as <dfn>ComponentSets</dfn>.</p>

<p>So, a <dfn>Component</dfn> is a self-contained item represented in an IMC
file, such as a vCard or an iCalendar.</p>

<p>Let us consider what a single IMC Component may contain. Conceptually, a
vCard component concerns itself with a single person, organization or
mailing-list. In the case of a vCard, it will contain a name, maybe an address
or two, a telephone number or three, and an e-mail address or sixty. Each of
these sub-elements is called a <dfn>Property</dfn>. Properties have property
names: in the case of vCard properties, names such as TEL, EMAIL, ADR and so
on.</p>

<p>But we have to dig deeper. Consider the case of a person's telephone numbers
or addresses. These may relate to his or her work or home, or some hobby or
other. the vCard specification allows these different attributes to be labelled
according to the role they play. Remembering that these are Properties of
Components, we have the additional (and final) layer of detail: Parameters.
<dfn>Parameters</dfn> specify qualifying information about Properties.</p>

<p>So we see four layers:</p>
<ol>
  <li>ComponentSets have Components</li>
  <li>Components have Properties</li>
  <li>Properties have Parameters</li>
  <li>Parameters have Names and Values</li>
</ol>

<p>One trap for the unwary: PHP classes have "properties" too. We try to refer
to these as "class properties" to avoid confusion as far as possible.</p>

<p>Another: PHP functions have "parameters". We try to refer to IMC Properties
with a capital 'P'.</p>

<h2 id="L539">5. Object decomposition</h2>

<p>We clearly have four kinds of things here. How do we represent them as PHP
objects? Starting from the outermost layer:</p>

<h3 id="L616">5.1. ComponentSets</h3>

<p>ComponentSets are just glorified arrays. All they need to do is read in one
or more Component objects. <code>imc\ComponentSet</code> thus derives from
<code>\ArrayObject</code>. To iterate over the individual components, just do a
foreach - each element will be a Component.</p>

<h3 id="L623">5.2. Components</h3>

<p>Because Components are somewhat recursive, tree-like entities, they have
some ComponentSet attributes (including, for example, the ability to write
themselves out as files). Thus, <code>imc\Component</code> inherits from
<code>imc\ComponentSet</code>. Components also provide access to their
Properties. Because Components can (at least, in the case of iCalendar
Components) contain sub-Components, they, too, are ArrayObjects. But because
they have an interesting structure, they are organized not as simple arrays but
as associative arrays - with the added bonus that their array members can be
accessed as object properties. So, for example, if a vCalendar object
<var>$vc</var> contains a VEVENT, it can be accessed either as
<code>$vc['VEVENT']</code> or as <code>$vc-&gt;VEVENT</code>. They have a
number of methods to access their Properties.</p>

<h3 id="L632">5.3. Properties</h3>

<p>Properties are all subclasses of <code>imc\Property</code>. This base class
is rather feature-rich. You should derive from it for one of two reasons:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>You need a specialized constructor:</dt>
    <dd>look at class <code>imc\customProperty</code> and its derivatives.</dd>
  <dt>The value is complex:</dt>
    <dd>look at classes <code>imc\arrayProperty</code> and
      <code>imc\PropertyRRULE</code>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>To get hold of a Component's Properties, look at the functions of the
Component. Some of them will return Property iterators. For Properties you know
to be unique, see <code>Component::getUniqueProperty()</code>.</p>

<p>Properties keep their parameters quite private (protected actually). This is
because a change to a parameter could involve changes to the value also.
Therefore, if you need to access a property's parameters, see Customizing
Properties below.</p>

<h3 id="L651">5.4. Parameters</h3>

<p>Finally, the Parameters of Properties are simple enough that we can treat
them as strings. After all, they are represented that way in the IMC file. Yes,
they could have been wrapped in objects. But they are no more than a name and a
list of one or more values. The only thing that this package does to Parameters
is to enforce upper case on their names. Parameter values, then, are stored as
comma-separated strings (and if there is a comma in any of the values, it is
escaped with a backslash).</p>

<h2 id="L1031">6. Files to include</h2>

<p>If you are working with vCards, you should <code>include</code> or
<code>require</code> imc_vCard.php. If you are working with iCalendars, you
should include imc_iCal.php. Optionally, if you are working with dates in
iCalendar land, you can include imcPropertydt.php, which will cause DTSTART,
DTEND and other date/time property values to be interpreted into DateTime
objects that you can manipulate.</p>

<p>If you want to mask out properties from a <code>getProperties()</code> or
<code>getPropertiesOfType()</code> call on a component, you will need the
<code>imc\propertyTypeMask</code> FilterIterator, and you should include
imc_ptm.php to supply it. It is not needed by any of the standard classes and
there is no risk of its inclusion without your knowing.</p>

<h2 id="L586">7. Extending</h2>

<p>If you are seeking to build IMC objects from non-IMC data, life may be made
simpler by extending the existing Component and Property classes. The
Outlook-to-Evolution example program will furnish an example. For further
advice, see <a href="#ExtendingProperties">Extending Properties</a> below.</p>

<p>If you are seeking to extract more valuable data from an IMC file, you may
need to build more capable extensions of the classes in this package. In that
case, you need to work with the factory mechanism.</p>

<h3 id="L690">7.1. Factories</h3>

<p>When reading IMC data files, <code>imc\ComponentSet</code> encounters
Component names; for example, in an iCalendar file it will encounter
"BEGIN:VCALENDAR". Rather than "knowing" what class to build, the ComponentSet
factory method looks up "VCALENDAR" in its registry and, if found, it
constructs an object of the appropriate class. If it doesn't find a match, it
constructs instead a member of the base <code>imc\Component</code> class.
Similarly, if it finds a property, e.g. "ADR", it invokes the
<code>imc\Property</code> factory method, which either finds a specialized
Property class and creates an instance of that, or else constructs a default
<code>imc\Property</code> object.</p>

<p>Both <code>imc\ComponentSet</code> and <code>imc\Property</code> employ a
similar factory mechanism. They maintain a list of IMC Component or Property
names coupled with the names of the related classes that best construct an
object from the data. As an example, the vCard ADR property has seven fields
that need special handling. The <code>imc\PropertyAdr</code> class thus
registers itself to be invoked by the <code>imc\Property</code> factory
function whenever a Property with name ADR is encountered. The factory method
then calls the constructor of the registered class rather than the base
Property class.</p>

<p>Apart from calling the class registration method, the extending class needs
to know the constructor arguments that the factory is using. The best place to
start is the constructor of another class that is registered in the same
factory.</p>

<p>It is possible to override a previously-registered class for the same
Property; when you do, the registration function will return the name of the
class being overridden.</p>

<h3 id="ExtendingProperties">7.2. Extending Properties</h3>

<p>The base <code>imc\Property</code> class is designed to provide good
functionality to its descendants (and if it blocks that, it needs changing!).
Nevertheless, it keeps its value and parameters zealously protected, for the
good reason that if the application changes a property parameter, it may
require a corresponding change on the value, and <span xml:lang="la">vice
versa</span>. If you need to make certain changes to the value at the
application level, you should consider the implications for the parameters.
Here is an example.</p>

<p>In the case of the iCalendar DTSTART, DTEND and other date/time values, it
may be desirable to change the time-zone. But when you change the time-zone,
both the property value (the date/time string) and the property parameters (the
TZID parameter) will need to change how they are represented in the IMC
file.</p>

<p>In more detail: if a time zone is GMT or UTC, there is no TZID parameter,
but the time value proclaims itself as being a GMT value. But if the time zone
is changed from GMT to, say, Europe/Athens, then the TZID must change and the
time value must accommodate that change by representing itself appropriately.
An examination of <code>imc\PropertyDT</code> will give an idea of the approach
needed.</p>

<p>For this reason, Property parameters must be protected, and functions
supplied to the application layer if they need to change them. Likewise,
although public methods are provided to set the property value, you can hook
them, and should if you need to fix up the property parameters.</p>

<p>Property values are typically strings; but sometimes not. Especially when
their values are not strings (e.g. arrays of strings, as in the case of
<code>imc\ProperyADR</code>), it is important to distinguish what they are
being used for. Internally, the property value is held in the most generally
useful way; and this might not precisely coincide with what you want to do with
it now! If you want to get the property value to include in a report – an
e-mail list, say – your requirements will be different from those you have
when you are saving the property value to an IMC file. Therefore, when you
extend a property class, you should be mindful of the following
presumptions:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>imc\Property::getValue()</code></dt>
    <dd>This returns the property value in a form presumed suitable for
      handling at the application level. It should either be a string suitable
      for display in a report, or an object with a <code>__toString()</code>
      method that will enable it to comply with this requirement.</dd>
  <dt><code>imc\Property::setValue</code></dt>
    <dd>This must not only set the property value but adjust any property
      parameters that need changing.</dd>
  <dt><code>imc\Property::get_encodeable_value()</code></dt>
    <dd>This must return the value in a form that, if there is no special
      encoding used, will be valid in an IMC file.</dd>
  <dt><code>imc\Property::setEncodedValue(string)</code></dt>
    <dd>This function is the "hook" whereby a generic string format can be
      converted to whatever your class needs to be useful. Here you should call
      <code>imc\Property::setEncodedValue()</code> to get the perhaps encoded
      value done; and then, taking <var>$this-&gt;value</var> as thus set,
      provide any transformation your class needs in order to make the value
      usable for your application. Class <code>imc\PropertyDT</code> and the
      descendants of <code>imc\arrayProperty</code> are good examples to
    follow.</dd>
