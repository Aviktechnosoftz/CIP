The scope of works includes construction of a new 10,500m2 warehouse with a 500m2 office, heavy duty pavements, carpark and landscaping.</p><p></p><p>Context of the EMP</p><p>An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) is required to outline environmental management practices and procedures to be followed during the construction of the warehouse and office.  The EMP provides a tool for ensuring that relevant requirements are observed during the project.</p><p>The EMP provides, but is not limited to:</p><p>A description of the roles and responsibilities for all relevant employees involved in the construction  activities; and</p><p>The EMP outlines environmental management responsibilities, anticipated statutory requirements, incident management, corrective action procedures, and complaint handling responsibilities, auditing requirements and training programs.</p><p>Section 5 of this EMP contains actions and checklists to assist in monitoring compliance with the EMP.</p><p>This document is designed as a dynamic document that should be reviewed and amended as needed to incorporate additional requirements, and/or modifications in the construction approach and schedule.  CIP, appointed as the Principal Contractor, by Client’s Name is required to draw on the requirements of the EMP and incorporate these into all Work Method Statements. </p><p>This EMP should be read in conjunction with the CIP’s Integrated Management System and associated procedures identified under relevant sections of this Plan, developed for the site.</p><p></p><p>Objectives of the Environmental Management Plan</p><p>The primary objective of this EMP is to provide an environmental management manual to be used by management and construction staff involved in the activities of the site to minimise adverse environmental impacts.  The EMP will also provide information to relevant regulatory authorities regarding the environmental management practices that will be implemented throughout construction.  The EMP has the following objectives:</p><p>To reduce or eliminate the release of pollutants into the environment during construction;</p><p>To promote environmental awareness amongst employees and contractors and best environmental practise; and</p><p>To reduce waste generation and the depletion of resources by utilising the “avoid, reduce, reuse, recycle” principles where practicable and appropriate.</p><p></p><p>Applicable legal and other requirements</p><p>The development of this project is governed by the approved Development Application (DA) and Conditions of Consent (CoC). The CoCs are detailed in the DA Compliance Matrix that forms an integral part of this EMP.</p><p>The applicable legal and other requirements are identified in the relevant management plans in Section 5. Copies of these plans and documents are available from the Site Manager.</p><p>Compliance with the applicable legal and other requirements is assessed by regular monitoring of environmental controls through site inspections and audits.</p><p>This document has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the AS/NZS ISO 14001:2004  Environmental Management Systems.</p><p></p><p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p><p>Location and Site Description</p><p>Site address: Project Address</p><p></p><p>Progression &amp; Duration of Construction Works</p><p>The overall construction works are scheduled to be completed within xxxx months.</p><p></p><p>Key Stakeholders</p><p>The key stakeholders for the project include:</p><p>Client (Principal and owner of land)</p><p></p><p>Construction Hours</p><p>As per the DA, the construction activities associated with the works, including the delivery of materials to and from the site, are to be within the hours of 7.00 am to 7.00 pm from Monday to Friday, 6.00 am to 1.00 pm on Saturdays and no work on Sundays or Public Holiday. All work will occur within these stipulated times.</p><p></p><p>Staffing </p><p>The number of personnel associated with the works will fluctuate depending upon the particular work stage and the level of work required.  At peak periods, it is estimated that the construction staff would be approximately 70 people.  Indicatively, the internal staff will comprised of:</p><p>Project Manager (PM)</p><p>Site Manager (SM)</p><p>Site Engineer</p><p>Contract Administrator (CA)</p><p>Health and Safety Representative (HSR)</p><p></p><p>Materials Management</p><p>The management of materials will follow as far as practicable, the principles of ecologically sustainable development and a waste minimisation hierarchy.  The hierarchy for waste minimisation is as follows:</p><p>Avoid - preventing the generation of waste in the first place;</p><p>Reduce - reducing waste involves creating less waste;</p><p>Reuse - finding or adapting products after their initial use so that they have the same, similar or alternative uses, thus extending the life of a product; and</p><p>Recycle - a process by which materials that would otherwise become solid waste are collected, separated, processed and returned to the economic mainstream in the form of raw materials or product. </p><p>Dispose – Remove from site materials not able to be incorporated into the works.</p><p>Consideration has been made to the reuse of materials on site, so there is no import or export of materials to obtain the correct site elevations. Consideration will also be given to and include:</p><p>Using recycled materials where possible;</p><p>Maximising opportunities to generate less waste, such as wrapping/packaging to be returned to the supplier, recyclable or biodegradable/compost able;</p><p>Avoiding unnecessary waste creation; and</p><p>Minimising consumption of resources by ordering only required amounts of materials. The waste management procedures identified are incorporated into the waste action plan (Section 5.2).</p><p></p><p></p><p>PROJECT ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE</p><p>The organisational structure of CIP Constructions that will be used during construction is provided in Figure 1</p><p>Roles and Responsibilities</p><p>The preliminary roles and responsibilities of personnel working on the project are outlined below.</p><p>Project Management Team</p><p>The Project Management Team (PMT) is comprised of the Principal Contractor’s personnel and will consist of the roles of the PM, SM and the HSR.

The action plans set out the environmental monitoring and management tasks that need to be undertaken during the works.  Details regarding the location and frequency of monitoring and auditing are specified. Each action plan specifies the monitoring required to assess the effectiveness of environmental controls and who is responsible for each action.

Records of this induction will be maintained.</p><p>CIP’s construction supervisor is responsible for training all subcontractors’ employees in relation to this EMP and ensuring subcontractor’s personnel attend their induction training. Anyone found departing from the environmental requirements and breaching the controls on site will face strict disciplinary action and potential for permanent removal from the site.</p><p></p><p>On-going Training</p><p>CIP and the subcontractor’s construction supervisor will be responsible for ensuring all personnel working on-site receive on-going training if construction activities/plan/schedule change or as the need arises.</p><p></p><p>INCIDENT MANAGEMENT</p><p>An emergency and incident response plan has been prepared for the demolition and import/ preload phase of the project.  The emergency and incident response plan includes the procedures to be followed during any incidents that can cause environmental damage.</p><p>Any incident likely to cause pollution of the site (such as an oil or chemical spill or accident) must be reported immediately to the SM.  If the incident results in a breach of legislative provisions, then SM must inform the PM &amp; HSR.  The PM will contact relevant authorities (including the DERM) as required.</p><p>The DERM must be notified of incidents causing or threatening material harm to the environment as soon as practicable after a person/organisation becomes aware of the incident.  The HSR, in his EM role, is responsible for notification to the DERM.  Written details of the incident must be notified to the DERM within 7 days of the date on which the incident occurred, if requested by the DERM.  Whilst all reporting will occur via the EM, subcontractors and other personnel are required to assist to the fullest extent possible in the notification and reporting of such incidents.</p><p>The DERM may make a written request for further details in relation to any of the above matters if it is not satisfied with the report provided by CIP.  CIP will provide such further details to the DERM within the time specified in the request.  Relevant personnel involved with the construction activities on site must be made aware of such requests and facilitate the attainment of these requirements.</p><p>Emergency scenarios for this project include the following:</p><p>Chemical &amp; Oil spills and leaks</p><p>Fire</p><p>Contamination</p><p>Unexpected find</p><p>Damage to heritage structure</p><p>Emergency contact numbers are provided in Table 1.0.</p><p>Incidents are recorded in the incident report and investigation, as necessary, is carried out to assess the root cause of incident to prevent its recurrence.</p><p></p><p>CHECKING, CORRECTIVE ACTION AND REPORTING</p><p>Training Records</p><p>Section 5.12 of this EMP details the initial site induction and on-going environmental training that all personnel working on the construction will be required to undertake.  The SM will ensure all employees working on-site have received initial site induction and environmental training.  Records of all training undertaken at the construction site will be maintained by the SM.  The SM will therefore be able to assess the competency of individuals in accordance with their roles and responsibilities.</p><p>Site Environmental Inspections and Checklist</p><p>A site environmental checklist is a simple means for checking the day-to-day environmental controls at a site and recording the details in a manner that is available for inspection.  It provides a series of items that can be quickly examined to provide an accurate indication of the effectiveness of safeguards contained in the EMP.  An environmental checklist has been developed to cover environmental aspects and impacts identified in Section 4.2 and Section 5.  The checklist will be revised as necessary to ensure that it is specific to the site and work to be undertaken.</p><p>Inspections will be undertaken by the project personnel.  If any deficiency is detected it shall be fixed and a record is made of the corrective action taken.  A timeline for corrective actions will be established dependent upon the nature of the action, however, the goal will be to ensure all corrective actions are closed out as soon as possible.</p><p>During periods of rainfall greater than 10mm per day, all work areas will be visited and the erosion control facilities inspected by the SM.</p><p>Non-conformance, Corrective Action and Preventive Action</p><p>Corrective and preventive action, as appropriate, will be undertaken when non-conformances and incidents occur at the construction site.  These will occur at times that include when:</p><p>A complaint is received regarding any pollution or other environmental impact caused by construction site activities;</p><p>A departure from approved or agreed procedures (i.e. performance targets specified in Section 5) is observed;</p><p>A non-conformance is identified as a consequence of any self-assessment, formal audit or other environmental survey or inspection.</p><p>If the non-conformance is considered to breach legislative requirements, the SM will be responsible for notifying the PM who will be responsible for reporting any perceived breaches of legislative requirements to the appropriate regulatory authority as soon as possible.</p><p>Non-conformances will be analysed and investigated by the SM and/or PM to determine the cause of the non-conformance and to develop a corrective action to prevent recurrence.  The SM and/or the PM will record all non-conformances and ensure that the corrective actions are undertaken as soon as possible. Refer to procedure for Nonconformity, Corrective Action and Preventive Action for more details.</p><p>Auditing</p><p>CIP has implemented an internal audit regime for its offices and project sites. Audits are carried out to determine the compliance with the IMS, EMP and AS/NZS ISO 14001:2004. </p><p>The PM will arrange audits of the subcontractor’s activities as necessary to determine compliance with the EMP.  The frequency of audits will be determined by the PM and the need for these audits will be reviewed throughout the duration of the project. Refer to procedure for Internal Audits for more details.</p><p>CONTROL OF DOCUMENTS AND RECORDS</p><p>Distribution and control of this EMP and related documents is the responsibility of CIP’s Project Management Team. All project personnel shall be provided access to the correct revision of the EMP. A copy of these documents is also made available on E-site for reference purposes.</p><p>This EMP is considered to be a dynamic document, which will be reviewed at the regular PMT meetings and any amendments required will be made accordingly to reflect changes to the project conditions.</p><p>Changes to the EMP will be communicated to the appropriate level of responsibility through inductions, on-going training and the issue of revised documentation where necessary.</p><p>Records are maintained to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this EMP, CoC, CIP IMS, etc. The records maintained for the project construction activities are available on site and E-site.</p><p>Refer to procedure for Control of Documents and Records for more details.</p><p></p><p>MANAGEMENT REVIEW</p><p>Environmental Management Review</p><p>The performance and effectiveness of the implementation of this EMP and related documents is reviewed at the regular PMT and client meetings. Participation from other project staff, specialist consultants, and stakeholders, as appropriate, will be included.</p><p>Following meetings are held on site where the performance of EMP is reviewed:</p><p>Regular Project Team Meetings</p><p>Monthly Project Control Group meetings/report</p><p>Records of these meetings are maintained in the form of minutes and the PMT is responsible to ensure that actions arising out of these meetings are taken in a timely manner.</p><p>CIP senior management also regularly reviews the performance of its Environmental Management System across the company as part of the IMS review. Records of these meetings are maintained in the form of minutes held in the Sydney office.</p><p>Continual Improvement</p><p>Continual improvement of the EMP will be achieved by continually evaluating environmental management performance against environmental policies, objectives and targets for the purpose of identifying opportunities for improvement.  The continual improvement process for the project has been designed to:</p><p>Identify areas of opportunity for improvement of environmental management which leads to improved environmental performance;</p><p>Determine the root cause or causes of non-conformances and deficiencies;</p><p>Develop and implement a plan of corrective and preventative action to address root causes;</p><p>Verify the effectiveness of the corrective and preventative actions;</p><p>Document any changes in procedures resulting from process improvement;</p><p>Make comparisons with objectives and targets.</p><p>Implementation of strategies/techniques to improve the environmental performance of the construction works is the responsibility of the PM.  Actions and further opportunities for continual improvement will be discussed at Project Management Team Meetings as required.</p><p>APPENDICES</p><p>Appendix AEnvironmental Check List</p><p>Appendix BErosion and Sediment Management Plan</p><p>Appendix CComplaints Register </p><p>Appendix DProject Specific Traffic Management Plan</p><p>Appendix EDust Monitoring Methodology (if applicable to your DA)</p><p>Appendix FVegitation Management Plan (if applicable to your DA)</p><p>Appendix GRehabilitation Plan (if applicable to your DA)</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>DOCUMENT REVISON HISTORY</p><p>Issue No</p><p>Date</p><p>Sec No</p><p>Brief Description of Change</p><p>Reason</p><p>Prepared By</p><p>Approved By</p><p>1.0</p><p>Sep 12</p><p>All sect</p><p>Initial setup</p><p>Set up of project</p><p>PM</p><p>CM</p><p>2.0</p><p>8 August 2014</p><p>Policy</p><p>Environmental Management Policy updated </p><p>Environmental Management Policy reviewed and revision updated.</p><p>KA</p><p>RB</p><p></p><p></p><p>General</p><p>Revision numbers updated accordingly.</p><p>To reflect above change.</p><p>KA</p><p>RB</p><p>3.0</p><p>Oct 2014</p><p>All</p><p>Site Engineer added to section 3.</p><p>General maintenance/tidy.</p><p>RB felt this was important to be included in the EMP.</p><p>N/A</p><p>KA</p><p>RB</p><p>4.0</p><p>Jul 16</p><p>All</p><p>Reformating</p><p>CIP Rebranding</p><p>KA</p><p>RB</p><p>5.0</p><p>Aug 16</p><p>Intro.</p><p>Environmental Policy update</p><p>New Environmental policy issued.</p><p>KA</p><p>RB</p><p></p></Content>
